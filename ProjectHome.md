## Project Description ##
This application forwards the received sms to a given e-mail address. It includes a widget that allows to easily enable or disable the forwarding opposed to other identical projects (e.g. [sms2email](http://code.google.com/p/sms2email/)).


## Remarks ##
It is my first (complete) android project based on several tutorials, projects and code samples found on the internet. It contains the javamail-android library for sending e-mail. If you checkout the source, don't forget to include this [lib](http://code.google.com/p/javamail-android/) !

Don't hesitate to send me feedback !
